<div class="about-me">
    <p style="width: 500px;">
        I'm currently pursuing a Computer Science 
        Master's degree at UPenn. Thriving in the wine industry and 
        product marketing-related jobs for three years, I'm passionately 
        seeking to make an impact on the traditional production 
        industry with advanced computer technology as well as my 
        programming skills and product insights.</p>
